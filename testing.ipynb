However, database owners are allowed to analyze all tables in their databases, except shared catalogs. (The restriction for shared catalogs means that a true database-wideANALYZEcan only be performed by a superuser.)ANALYZEwill skip over any tables that the calling user does not have permission to analyze.\\nForeign tables are analyzed only when explicitly selected. Not all foreign data wrappers supportANALYZE. If the table's wrapper does not supportANALYZE, the command prints a warning and does nothing.\\nIn the defaultPostgreSQLconfiguration, the autovacuum daemon (seeSection\\xa025.1.6) takes care of automatic analyzing of tables when they are first loaded with data, and as they change throughout regular operation. When autovacuum is disabled, it is a good idea to runANALYZEperiodically, or just after making major changes in the contents of a table. Accurate statistics will help the planner to choose the most appropriate query plan, and thereby improve the speed of query processing. A common strategy for read-mostly databases is to runVACUUMandANALYZEonce a day during a low-usage time of day. (This will not be sufficient if there is heavy update activity.)\\nANALYZErequires only a read lock on the target table, so it can run in parallel with other activity on the table.\\nThe statistics collected byANALYZEusually include a list of some of the most common values in each column and a histogram showing the approximate data distribution in each column. One or both of these can be omitted ifANALYZEdeems them uninteresting (for example, in a unique-key column, there are no common values) or if the column data type does not support the appropriate operators. There is more information about the statistics inChapter\\xa025.\\nFor large tables,ANALYZEtakes a random sample of the table contents, rather than examining every row.
