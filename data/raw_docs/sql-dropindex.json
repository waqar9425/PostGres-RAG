A normalDROP INDEXacquires anACCESS EXCLUSIVElock on the table, blocking other accesses until the index drop can be completed. With this option, the command instead waits until conflicting transactions have completed.\nThere are several caveats to be aware of when using this option. Only one index name can be specified, and theCASCADEoption is not supported. (Thus, an index that supports aUNIQUEorPRIMARY KEYconstraint cannot be dropped this way.) Also, regularDROP INDEXcommands can be performed within a transaction block, butDROP INDEX CONCURRENTLYcannot. Lastly, indexes on partitioned tables cannot be dropped using this option.\nFor temporary tables,DROP INDEXis always non-concurrent, as no other session can access them, and non-concurrent index drop is cheaper.\nDo not throw an error if the index does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.\nThe name (optionally schema-qualified) of an index to remove.\nAutomatically drop objects that depend on the index, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (seeSection 5.14).\nRefuse to drop the index if any objects depend on it. This is the default.\n"
