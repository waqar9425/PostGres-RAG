      "text": "BEGINinitiates a transaction block, that is, all statements after aBEGINcommand will be executed in a single transaction until an explicitCOMMITorROLLBACKis given. By default (withoutBEGIN),PostgreSQLexecutes transactions in“autocommit”mode, that is, each statement is executed in its own transaction and a commit is implicitly performed at the end of the statement (if execution was successful, otherwise a rollback is done).\nStatements are executed more quickly in a transaction block, because transaction start/commit requires significant CPU and disk activity. Execution of multiple statements inside a transaction is also useful to ensure consistency when making several related changes: other sessions will be unable to see the intermediate states wherein not all the related updates have been done.\nIf the isolation level, read/write mode, or deferrable mode is specified, the new transaction has those characteristics, as ifSET TRANSACTIONwas executed.\n"

      "text": "START TRANSACTIONhas the same functionality asBEGIN.\nUseCOMMITorROLLBACKto terminate a transaction block.\nIssuingBEGINwhen already inside a transaction block will provoke a warning message. The state of the transaction is not affected. To nest transactions within a transaction block, use savepoints (seeSAVEPOINT).\nFor reasons of backwards compatibility, the commas between successivetransaction_modescan be omitted.\n"

You are advised to be careful about the transaction semantics when porting database applications.\n"
