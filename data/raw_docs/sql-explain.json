      "text": "This command displays the execution plan that thePostgreSQLplanner generates for the supplied statement. The execution plan shows how the table(s) referenced by the statement will be scanned — by plain sequential scan, index scan, etc. — and if multiple tables are referenced, what join algorithms will be used to bring together the required rows from each input table.\nThe most critical part of the display is the estimated statement execution cost, which is the planner's guess at how long it will take to run the statement (measured in cost units that are arbitrary, but conventionally mean disk page fetches). Actually two numbers are shown: the start-up cost before the first row can be returned, and the total cost to return all the rows. For most queries the total cost is what matters, but in contexts such as a subquery inEXISTS, the planner will choose the smallest start-up cost instead of the smallest total cost (since the executor will stop after getting one row, anyway). Also, if you limit the number of rows to return with aLIMITclause, the planner makes an appropriate interpolation between the endpoint costs to estimate which plan is really the cheapest.\nTheANALYZEoption causes the statement to be actually executed, not only planned. Then actual run time statistics are added to the display, including the total elapsed time expended within each plan node (in milliseconds) and the total number of rows it actually returned. This is useful for seeing whether the planner's estimates are close to reality.\n"

      "title": "Important",
      "text": "Keep in mind that the statement is actually executed when theANALYZEoption is used. AlthoughEXPLAINwill discard any output that aSELECTwould return, other side effects of the statement will happen as usual. If you wish to useEXPLAIN ANALYZEon anINSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,MERGE,CREATE TABLE AS, orEXECUTEstatement without letting the command affect your data, use this approach:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nBEGIN;\nEXPLAIN ANALYZE ...;\nROLLBACK;\n\nOnly theANALYZEandVERBOSEoptions can be specified, and only in that order, without surrounding the option list in parentheses. Prior toPostgreSQL9.0, the unparenthesized syntax was the only one supported. It is expected that all new options will be supported only in the parenthesized syntax.\n"

      "title": "Parameters",
      "text": "Carry out the command and show actual run times and other statistics. This parameter defaults toFALSE.\nDisplay additional information regarding the plan. Specifically, include the output column list for each node in the plan tree, schema-qualify table and function names, always label variables in expressions with their range table alias, and always print the name of each trigger for which statistics are displayed. The query identifier will also be displayed if one has been computed, seecompute_query_idfor more details. This parameter defaults toFALSE.\nInclude information on the estimated startup and total cost of each plan node, as well as the estimated number of rows and the estimated width of each row. This parameter defaults toTRUE.\nInclude information on configuration parameters. Specifically, include options affecting query planning with value different from the built-in default value. This parameter defaults toFALSE.\nAllow the statement to contain parameter placeholders like$1, and generate a generic plan that does not depend on the values of those parameters. SeePREPAREfor details about generic plans and the types of statement that support parameters. This parameter cannot be used together withANALYZE. It defaults toFALSE.\nInclude information on buffer usage. Specifically, include the number of shared blocks hit, read, dirtied, and written, the number of local blocks hit, read, dirtied, and written, the number of temp blocks read and written, and the time spent reading and writing data file blocks and temporary file blocks (in milliseconds) iftrack_io_timingis enabled. Ahitmeans that a read was avoided because the block was found already in cache when needed. Shared blocks contain data from regular tables and indexes; local blocks contain data from temporary tables and indexes; while temporary blocks contain short-term working data used in sorts, hashes, Materialize plan nodes, and similar cases. The number of blocksdirtiedindicates the number of previously unmodified blocks that were changed by this query; while the number of blockswrittenindicates the number of previously-dirtied blocks evicted from cache by this backend during query processing. The number of blocks shown for an upper-level node includes those used by all its child nodes. In text format, only non-zero values are printed. This parameter defaults toFALSE.\nInclude information on WAL record generation. Specifically, include the number of records, number of full page images (fpi) and the amount of WAL generated in bytes. In text format, only non-zero values are printed. This parameter may only be used whenANALYZEis also enabled. It defaults toFALSE.\nInclude actual startup time and time spent in each node in the output. The overhead of repeatedly reading the system clock can slow down the query significantly on some systems, so it may be useful to set this parameter toFALSEwhen only actual row counts, and not exact times, are needed. Run time of the entire statement is always measured, even when node-level timing is turned off with this option. This parameter may only be used whenANALYZEis also enabled. It defaults toTRUE.\nInclude summary information (e.g., totaled timing information) after the query plan. Summary information is included by default whenANALYZEis used but otherwise is not included by default, but can be enabled using this option. Planning time inEXPLAIN EXECUTEincludes the time required to fetch the plan from the cache and the time required for re-planning, if necessary.\nSpecify the output format, which can be TEXT, XML, JSON, or YAML. Non-text output contains the same information as the text output format, but is easier for programs to parse. This parameter defaults toTEXT.\nSpecifies whether the selected option should be turned on or off. You can writeTRUE,ON, or1to enable the option, andFALSE,OFF, or0to disable it. Thebooleanvalue can also be omitted, in which caseTRUEis assumed.\nAnySELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,MERGE,VALUES,EXECUTE,DECLARE,CREATE TABLE AS, orCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ASstatement, whose execution plan you wish to see.\n"

    {
      "title": "Notes",
      "text": "In order to allow thePostgreSQLquery planner to make reasonably informed decisions when optimizing queries, thepg_statisticdata should be up-to-date for all tables used in the query. Normally theautovacuum daemonwill take care of that automatically. But if a table has recently had substantial changes in its contents, you might need to do a manualANALYZErather than wait for autovacuum to catch up with the changes.\nIn order to measure the run-time cost of each node in the execution plan, the current implementation ofEXPLAIN ANALYZEadds profiling overhead to query execution. As a result, runningEXPLAIN ANALYZEon a query can sometimes take significantly longer than executing the query normally. The amount of overhead depends on the nature of the query, as well as the platform being used. The worst case occurs for plan nodes that in themselves require very little time per execution, and on machines that have relatively slow operating system calls for obtaining the time of day.\n"

Also note that the numbers, and even the selected query strategy, might vary betweenPostgreSQLreleases due to planner improvements. In addition, theANALYZEcommand uses random sampling to estimate data statistics; therefore, it is possible for cost estimates to change after a fresh run ofANALYZE, even if the actual distribution of data in the table has not changed.\nNotice that the previous example showed a“custom”plan for the specific parameter values given inEXECUTE. We might also wish to see the generic plan for a parameterized query, which can be done withGENERIC_PLAN:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nEXPLAIN (GENERIC_PLAN)\n  SELECT sum(bar) FROM test\n    WHERE id > $1 AND id < $2\n    GROUP BY foo;\n\n                                  QUERY PLAN\n-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------\n HashAggregate  (cost=26.79..26.89 rows=10 width=12)\n   Group Key: foo\n   ->  Index Scan using test_pkey on test  (cost=0.29..24.29 rows=500 width=8)\n         Index Cond: ((id > $1) AND (id < $2))\n(4 rows)\n\nIn this case the parser correctly inferred that$1and$2should have the same data type asid, so the lack of parameter type information fromPREPAREwas not a problem. In other cases it might be necessary to explicitly specify types for the parameter symbols, which can be done by casting them, for example:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nEXPLAIN (GENERIC_PLAN)\n  SELECT sum(bar) FROM test\n    WHERE id > $1::integer AND id < $2::integer\n    GROUP BY foo;\n\n"
