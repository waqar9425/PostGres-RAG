      "text": "CREATE ROLEadds a new role to aPostgreSQLdatabase cluster. A role is an entity that can own database objects and have database privileges; a role can be considered a“user”, a“group”, or both depending on how it is used. Refer toChapter 22andChapter 21for information about managing users and authentication. You must haveCREATEROLEprivilege or be a database superuser to use this command.\nNote that roles are defined at the database cluster level, and so are valid in all databases in the cluster.\nDuring role creation it is possible to immediately assign the newly created role to be a member of an existing role, and also assign existing roles to be members of the newly created role. The rules for which initial role membership options are enabled are described below in theIN ROLE,ROLE, andADMINclauses. TheGRANTcommand has fine-grained option control during membership creation, and the ability to modify these options after the new role is created.\n"

      "title": "Parameters",
      "text": "The name of the new role.\nThese clauses determine whether the new role is a“superuser”, who can override all access restrictions within the database. Superuser status is dangerous and should be used only when really needed. You must yourself be a superuser to create a new superuser. If not specified,NOSUPERUSERis the default.\nThese clauses define a role's ability to create databases. IfCREATEDBis specified, the role being defined will be allowed to create new databases. SpecifyingNOCREATEDBwill deny a role the ability to create databases. If not specified,NOCREATEDBis the default. Only superuser roles or roles withCREATEDBcan specifyCREATEDB.\nThese clauses determine whether a role will be permitted to create, alter, drop, comment on, and change the security label for other roles. Seerole creationfor more details about what capabilities are conferred by this privilege. If not specified,NOCREATEROLEis the default.\nThis affects the membership inheritance status when this role is added as a member of another role, both in this and future commands. Specifically, it controls the inheritance status of memberships added with this command using theIN ROLEclause, and in later commands using theROLEclause. It is also used as the default inheritance status when adding this role as a member using theGRANTcommand. If not specified,INHERITis the default.\nInPostgreSQLversions before 16, inheritance was a role-level attribute that controlled all runtime membership checks for that role.\nThese clauses determine whether a role is allowed to log in; that is, whether the role can be given as the initial session authorization name during client connection. A role having theLOGINattribute can be thought of as a user. Roles without this attribute are useful for managing database privileges, but are not users in the usual sense of the word. If not specified,NOLOGINis the default, except whenCREATE ROLEis invoked through its alternative spellingCREATE USER.\nThese clauses determine whether a role is a replication role. A role must have this attribute (or be a superuser) in order to be able to connect to the server in replication mode (physical or logical replication) and in order to be able to create or drop replication slots. A role having theREPLICATIONattribute is a very highly privileged role, and should only be used on roles actually used for replication. If not specified,NOREPLICATIONis the default. Only superuser roles or roles withREPLICATIONcan specifyREPLICATION.\nThese clauses determine whether a role bypasses every row-level security (RLS) policy.NOBYPASSRLSis the default. Only superuser roles or roles withBYPASSRLScan specifyBYPASSRLS.\nNote that pg_dump will setrow_securitytoOFFby default, to ensure all contents of a table are dumped out. If the user running pg_dump does not have appropriate permissions, an error will be returned. However, superusers and the owner of the table being dumped always bypass RLS.\nIf role can log in, this specifies how many concurrent connections the role can make. -1 (the default) means no limit. Note that only normal connections are counted towards this limit. Neither prepared transactions nor background worker connections are counted towards this limit.\nSets the role's password. (A password is only of use for roles having theLOGINattribute, but you can nonetheless define one for roles without it.) If you do not plan to use password authentication you can omit this option. If no password is specified, the password will be set to null and password authentication will always fail for that user. A null password can optionally be written explicitly asPASSWORD NULL.\n"
    },
    {
      "title": "Note",
      "text": "Specifying an empty string will also set the password to null, but that was not the case beforePostgreSQLversion 10. In earlier versions, an empty string could be used, or not, depending on the authentication method and the exact version, and libpq would refuse to use it in any case. To avoid the ambiguity, specifying an empty string should be avoided.\nThe password is always stored encrypted in the system catalogs. TheENCRYPTEDkeyword has no effect, but is accepted for backwards compatibility. The method of encryption is determined by the configuration parameterpassword_encryption. If the presented password string is already in MD5-encrypted or SCRAM-encrypted format, then it is stored as-is regardless ofpassword_encryption(since the system cannot decrypt the specified encrypted password string, to encrypt it in a different format). This allows reloading of encrypted passwords during dump/restore.\nTheVALID UNTILclause sets a date and time after which the role's password is no longer valid. If this clause is omitted the password will be valid for all time.\nTheIN ROLEclause causes the new role to be automatically added as a member of the specified existing roles. The new membership will have theSEToption enabled and theADMINoption disabled. TheINHERIToption will be enabled unless theNOINHERIToption is specified.\nIN GROUPis an obsolete spelling ofIN ROLE.\nTheROLEclause causes one or more specified existing roles to be automatically added as members, with theSEToption enabled. This in effect makes the new role a“group”. Roles named in this clause with the role-levelINHERITattribute will have theINHERIToption enabled in the new membership. New memberships will have theADMINoption disabled.\nTheADMINclause has the same effect asROLE, but the named roles are added as members of the new role withADMINenabled, giving them the right to grant membership in the new role to others.\nTheUSERclause is an obsolete spelling of theROLEclause.\nTheSYSIDclause is ignored, but is accepted for backwards compatibility.\n"

      "title": "Notes",
      "text": "UseALTER ROLEto change the attributes of a role, andDROP ROLEto remove a role. All the attributes specified byCREATE ROLEcan be modified by laterALTER ROLEcommands.\nThe preferred way to add and remove members of roles that are being used as groups is to useGRANTandREVOKE.\nTheVALID UNTILclause defines an expiration time for a password only, not for the role per se. In particular, the expiration time is not enforced when logging in using a non-password-based authentication method.\nThe role attributes defined here are non-inheritable, i.e., being a member of a role with, e.g.,CREATEDBwill not allow the member to create new databases even if the membership grant has theINHERIToption. Of course, if the membership grant has theSEToption the member role would be able toSET ROLEto the createdb role and then create a new database.\nThe membership grants created by theIN ROLE,ROLE, andADMINclauses have the role executing this command as the grantor.\nTheINHERITattribute is the default for reasons of backwards compatibility: in prior releases ofPostgreSQL, users always had access to all privileges of groups they were members of. However,NOINHERITprovides a closer match to the semantics specified in the SQL standard.\nPostgreSQLincludes a programcreateuserthat has the same functionality asCREATE ROLE(in fact, it calls this command) but can be run from the command shell.\nTheCONNECTION LIMIToption is only enforced approximately; if two new sessions start at about the same time when just one connection“slot”remains for the role, it is possible that both will fail. Also, the limit is never enforced for superusers.\nCaution must be exercised when specifying an unencrypted password with this command. The password will be transmitted to the server in cleartext, and it might also be logged in the client's command history or the server log. The commandcreateuser, however, transmits the password encrypted. Also,psqlcontains a command\\passwordthat can be used to safely change the password later.\n"

InPostgreSQLwe have chosen to unify users and roles into a single kind of entity. Roles therefore have many more optional attributes than they do in the standard.\nThe behavior specified by the SQL standard is most closely approximated creating SQL-standard users asPostgreSQLroles with theNOINHERIToption, and SQL-standard roles asPostgreSQLroles with theINHERIToption.\n"
