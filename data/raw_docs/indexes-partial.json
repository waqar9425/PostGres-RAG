      "text": "Apartial indexis an index built over a subset of a table; the subset is defined by a conditional expression (called thepredicateof the partial index). The index contains entries only for those table rows that satisfy the predicate. Partial indexes are a specialized feature, but there are several situations in which they are useful.\nOne major reason for using a partial index is to avoid indexing common values. Since a query searching for a common value (one that accounts for more than a few percent of all the table rows) will not use the index anyway, there is no point in keeping those rows in the index at all. This reduces the size of the index, which will speed up those queries that do use the index. It will also speed up many table update operations because the index does not need to be updated in all cases.Example 11.1shows a possible application of this idea.\nExample 11.1. Setting up a Partial Index to Exclude Common Values\nSuppose you are storing web server access logs in a database. Most accesses originate from the IP address range of your organization but some are from elsewhere (say, employees on dial-up connections). If your searches by IP are primarily for outside accesses, you probably do not need to index the IP range that corresponds to your organization's subnet.\nAssume a table like this:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nCREATE TABLE access_log (\n    url varchar,\n    client_ip inet,\n    ...\n);\n\nTo create a partial index that suits our example, use a command such as this:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nCREATE INDEX access_log_client_ip_ix ON access_log (client_ip)\nWHERE NOT (client_ip > inet '192.168.100.0' AND\n           client_ip < inet '192.168.100.255');\n\nA typical query that can use this index would be:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nSELECT *\nFROM access_log\nWHERE url = '/index.html' AND client_ip = inet '212.78.10.32';\n\nHere the query's IP address is covered by the partial index. The following query cannot use the partial index, as it uses an IP address that is excluded from the index:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nSELECT *\nFROM access_log\nWHERE url = '/index.html' AND client_ip = inet '192.168.100.23';\n\nObserve that this kind of partial index requires that the common values be predetermined, so such partial indexes are best used for data distributions that do not change. Such indexes can be recreated occasionally to adjust for new data distributions, but this adds maintenance effort.\nAnother possible use for a partial index is to exclude values from the index that the typical query workload is not interested in; this is shown inExample 11.2. This results in the same advantages as listed above, but it prevents the“uninteresting”values from being accessed via that index, even if an index scan might be profitable in that case. Obviously, setting up partial indexes for this kind of scenario will require a lot of care and experimentation.\nExample 11.2. Setting up a Partial Index to Exclude Uninteresting Values\nIf you have a table that contains both billed and unbilled orders, where the unbilled orders take up a small fraction of the total table and yet those are the most-accessed rows, you can improve performance by creating an index on just the unbilled rows. The command to create the index would look like this:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nCREATE INDEX orders_unbilled_index ON orders (order_nr)\n    WHERE billed is not true;\n\nA possible query to use this index would be:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nSELECT * FROM orders WHERE billed is not true AND order_nr < 10000;\n\nHowever, the index can also be used in queries that do not involveorder_nrat all, e.g.:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nSELECT * FROM orders WHERE billed is not true AND amount > 5000.00;\n\nThis is not as efficient as a partial index on theamountcolumn would be, since the system has to scan the entire index. Yet, if there are relatively few unbilled orders, using this partial index just to find the unbilled orders could be a win.\nNote that this query cannot use this index:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nSELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_nr = 3501;\n\nThe order 3501 might be among the billed or unbilled orders.\nExample 11.2also illustrates that the indexed column and the column used in the predicate do not need to match.PostgreSQLsupports partial indexes with arbitrary predicates, so long as only columns of the table being indexed are involved. However, keep in mind that the predicate must match the conditions used in the queries that are supposed to benefit from the index. To be precise, a partial index can be used in a query only if the system can recognize that theWHEREcondition of the query mathematically implies the predicate of the index.PostgreSQLdoes not have a sophisticated theorem prover that can recognize mathematically equivalent expressions that are written in different forms. (Not only is such a general theorem prover extremely difficult to create, it would probably be too slow to be of any real use.) The system can recognize simple inequality implications, for example“x < 1”implies“x < 2”; otherwise the predicate condition must exactly match part of the query'sWHEREcondition or the index will not be recognized as usable. Matching takes place at query planning time, not at run time. As a result, parameterized query clauses do not work with a partial index. For example a prepared query with a parameter might specify“x < ?”which will never imply“x < 2”for all possible values of the parameter.\nA third possible use for partial indexes does not require the index to be used in queries at all. The idea here is to create a unique index over a subset of a table, as inExample 11.3. This enforces uniqueness among the rows that satisfy the index predicate, without constraining those that do not.\nExample 11.3. Setting up a Partial Unique Index\nSuppose that we have a table describing test outcomes. We wish to ensure that there is only one“successful”entry for a given subject and target combination, but there might be any number of“unsuccessful”entries. Here is one way to do it:\n\n\nCODE:\n\nCREATE TABLE tests (\n    subject text,\n    target text,\n    success boolean,\n    ...\n);\n\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_success_constraint ON tests (subject, target)\n    WHERE success;\n\nThis is a particularly efficient approach when there are few successful tests and many unsuccessful ones. It is also possible to allow only one null in a column by creating a unique partial index with anIS NULLrestriction.\nFinally, a partial index can also be used to override the system's query plan choices. Also, data sets with peculiar distributions might cause the system to use an index when it really should not. In that case the index can be set up so that it is not available for the offending query. Normally,PostgreSQLmakes reasonable choices about index usage (e.g., it avoids them when retrieving common values, so the earlier example really only saves index size, it is not required to avoid index usage), and grossly incorrect plan choices are cause for a bug report.\nKeep in mind that setting up a partial index indicates that you know at least as much as the query planner knows, in particular you know when an index might be profitable. Forming this knowledge requires experience and understanding of how indexes inPostgreSQLwork. In most cases, the advantage of a partial index over a regular index will be minimal. There are cases where they are quite counterproductive, as inExample 11.4.\nExample 11.4. Do Not Use Partial Indexes as a Substitute for Partitioning\nYou might be tempted to create a large set of non-overlapping partial indexes, for example\n\n\nCODE:\n\nCREATE INDEX mytable_cat_1 ON mytable (data) WHERE category = 1;\nCREATE INDEX mytable_cat_2 ON mytable (data) WHERE category = 2;\nCREATE INDEX mytable_cat_3 ON mytable (data) WHERE category = 3;\n...\nCREATE INDEX mytable_cat_N ON mytable (data) WHERE category = N;\n\nThis is a bad idea! Almost certainly, you'll be better off with a single non-partial index, declared like\n\n\nCODE:\n\nCREATE INDEX mytable_cat_data ON mytable (category, data);\n\n(Put the category column first, for the reasons described inSection 11.3.) While a search in this larger index might have to descend through a couple more tree levels than a search in a smaller index, that's almost certainly going to be cheaper than the planner effort needed to select the appropriate one of the partial indexes. The core of the problem is that the system does not understand the relationship among the partial indexes, and will laboriously test each one to see if it's applicable to the current query.\nIf your table is large enough that a single index really is a bad idea, you should look into using partitioning instead (seeSection 5.11). With that mechanism, the system does understand that the tables and indexes are non-overlapping, so far better performance is possible.\nMore information about partial indexes can be found in[ston89b],[olson93], and[seshadri95].\n"
