      "text": "CREATE DATABASEcreates a newPostgreSQLdatabase.\nTo create a database, you must be a superuser or have the specialCREATEDBprivilege. SeeCREATE ROLE.\nBy default, the new database will be created by cloning the standard system databasetemplate1. A different template can be specified by writingTEMPLATEname. In particular, by writingTEMPLATE template0, you can create a pristine database (one where no user-defined objects exist and where the system objects have not been altered) containing only the standard objects predefined by your version ofPostgreSQL. This is useful if you wish to avoid copying any installation-local objects that might have been added totemplate1.\n"

      "text": "The name of a database to create.\nThe role name of the user who will own the new database, orDEFAULTto use the default (namely, the user executing the command). To create a database owned by another role, you must be able toSET ROLEto that role.\nThe name of the template from which to create the new database, orDEFAULTto use the default template (template1).\nCharacter set encoding to use in the new database. Specify a string constant (e.g.,'SQL_ASCII'), or an integer encoding number, orDEFAULTto use the default encoding (namely, the encoding of the template database). The character sets supported by thePostgreSQLserver are described inSection 24.3.1. See below for additional restrictions.\nStrategy to be used in creating the new database. If theWAL_LOGstrategy is used, the database will be copied block by block and each block will be separately written to the write-ahead log. This is the most efficient strategy in cases where the template database is small, and therefore it is the default. The olderFILE_COPYstrategy is also available. This strategy writes a small record to the write-ahead log for each tablespace used by the target database. Each such record represents copying an entire directory to a new location at the filesystem level. While this does reduce the write-ahead log volume substantially, especially if the template database is large, it also forces the system to perform a checkpoint both before and after the creation of the new database. In some situations, this may have a noticeable negative impact on overall system performance.\nSets the default collation order and character classification in the new database. Collation affects the sort order applied to strings, e.g., in queries withORDER BY, as well as the order used in indexes on text columns. Character classification affects the categorization of characters, e.g., lower, upper, and digit. Also sets the associated aspects of the operating system environment,LC_COLLATEandLC_CTYPE. The default is the same setting as the template database. SeeSection 24.2.2.3.1andSection 24.2.2.3.2for details.\nCan be overridden by settinglc_collate,lc_ctype, oricu_localeindividually.\n"

Possible values areicu(if the server was built with ICU support) orlibc. By default, the provider is the same as that of thetemplate. SeeSection 24.1.4for details.\nSpecifies the collation version string to store with the database. Normally, this should be omitted, which will cause the version to be computed from the actual version of the database collation as provided by the operating system. This option is intended to be used bypg_upgradefor copying the version from an existing installation.\nSee alsoALTER DATABASEfor how to handle database collation version mismatches.\nThe name of the tablespace that will be associated with the new database, orDEFAULTto use the template database's tablespace. This tablespace will be the default tablespace used for objects created in this database. SeeCREATE TABLESPACEfor more information.\nIf false then no one can connect to this database. The default is true, allowing connections (except as restricted by other mechanisms, such asGRANT/REVOKE CONNECT).\nHow many concurrent connections can be made to this database. -1 (the default) means no limit.\nIf true, then this database can be cloned by any user withCREATEDBprivileges; if false (the default), then only superusers or the owner of the database can clone it.\nThe object identifier to be used for the new database. If this parameter is not specified,PostgreSQLwill choose a suitable OID automatically.

      "title": "Notes",
      "text": "CREATE DATABASEcannot be executed inside a transaction block.\nErrors along the line of“could not initialize database directory”are most likely related to insufficient permissions on the data directory, a full disk, or other file system problems.\nUseDROP DATABASEto remove a database.\nThe programcreatedbis a wrapper program around this command, provided for convenience.\nDatabase-level configuration parameters (set viaALTER DATABASE) and database-level permissions (set viaGRANT) are not copied from the template database.\nAlthough it is possible to copy a database other thantemplate1by specifying its name as the template, this is not (yet) intended as a general-purpose“COPY DATABASE”facility. The principal limitation is that no other sessions can be connected to the template database while it is being copied.CREATE DATABASEwill fail if any other connection exists when it starts; otherwise, new connections to the template database are locked out untilCREATE DATABASEcompletes. SeeSection 23.3for more information.\nThe character set encoding specified for the new database must be compatible with the chosen locale settings (LC_COLLATEandLC_CTYPE). If the locale isC(or equivalentlyPOSIX), then all encodings are allowed, but for other locale settings there is only one encoding that will work properly. (On Windows, however, UTF-8 encoding can be used with any locale.)CREATE DATABASEwill allow superusers to specifySQL_ASCIIencoding regardless of the locale settings, but this choice is deprecated and may result in misbehavior of character-string functions if data that is not encoding-compatible with the locale is stored in the database.\nThe encoding and locale settings must match those of the template database, except whentemplate0is used as template. This is because other databases might contain data that does not match the specified encoding, or might contain indexes whose sort ordering is affected byLC_COLLATEandLC_CTYPE. Copying such data would result in a database that is corrupt according to the new settings.template0, however, is known to not contain any data or indexes that would be affected.\nThere is currently no option to use a database locale with nondeterministic comparisons (seeCREATE COLLATIONfor an explanation). If this is needed, then per-column collations would need to be used.\nTheCONNECTION LIMIToption is only enforced approximately; if two new sessions start at about the same time when just one connection“slot”remains for the database, it is possible that both will fail. Also, the limit is not enforced against superusers or background worker processes.\n"
