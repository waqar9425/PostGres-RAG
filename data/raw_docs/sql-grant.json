      "text": "TheGRANTcommand has two basic variants: one that grants privileges on a database object (table, column, view, foreign table, sequence, database, foreign-data wrapper, foreign server, function, procedure, procedural language, large object, configuration parameter, schema, tablespace, or type), and one that grants membership in a role. These variants are similar in many ways, but they are different enough to be described separately.\n"
    },
    {
      "title": "GRANT on Database Objects",
      "text": "This variant of theGRANTcommand gives specific privileges on a database object to one or more roles. These privileges are added to those already granted, if any.\nThe key wordPUBLICindicates that the privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that might be created later.PUBLICcan be thought of as an implicitly defined group that always includes all roles. Any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted toPUBLIC.\nIfWITH GRANT OPTIONis specified, the recipient of the privilege can in turn grant it to others. Without a grant option, the recipient cannot do that. Grant options cannot be granted toPUBLIC.\nIfGRANTED BYis specified, the specified grantor must be the current user. This clause is currently present in this form only for SQL compatibility.\nThere is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object (usually the user that created it), as the owner has all privileges by default. (The owner could, however, choose to revoke some of their own privileges for safety.)\nThe right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is not treated as a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner, and cannot be granted or revoked. (However, a similar effect can be obtained by granting or revoking membership in the role that owns the object; see below.) The owner implicitly has all grant options for the object, too.\nThe possible privileges are:\nSpecific types of privileges, as defined inSection 5.7.\nAlternative spelling forTEMPORARY.\nGrant all of the privileges available for the object's type. ThePRIVILEGESkey word is optional inPostgreSQL, though it is required by strict SQL.\nTheFUNCTIONsyntax works for plain functions, aggregate functions, and window functions, but not for procedures; usePROCEDUREfor those. Alternatively, useROUTINEto refer to a function, aggregate function, window function, or procedure regardless of its precise type.\nThere is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same type within one or more schemas. This functionality is currently supported only for tables, sequences, functions, and procedures.ALL TABLESalso affects views and foreign tables, just like the specific-objectGRANTcommand.ALL FUNCTIONSalso affects aggregate and window functions, but not procedures, again just like the specific-objectGRANTcommand. UseALL ROUTINESto include procedures.\n"

    {
      "title": "GRANT on Roles",
      "text": "This variant of theGRANTcommand grants membership in a role to one or more other roles, and the modification of membership optionsSET,INHERIT, andADMIN; seeSection 22.3for details. Membership in a role is significant because it potentially allows access to the privileges granted to a role to each of its members, and potentially also the ability to make changes to the role itself. However, the actual permissions conferred depend on the options associated with the grant. To modify that options of an existing membership, simply specify the membership with updated option values.\nEach of the options described below can be set to eitherTRUEorFALSE. The keywordOPTIONis accepted as a synonym forTRUE, so thatWITH ADMIN OPTIONis a synonym forWITH ADMIN TRUE. When altering an existing membership the omission of an option results in the current value being retained.\nTheADMINoption allows the member to in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke membership in the role as well. Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot do that. A role is not considered to holdWITH ADMIN OPTIONon itself. Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any role to anyone. This option defaults toFALSE.\nTheINHERIToption controls the inheritance status of the new membership; seeSection 22.3for details on inheritance. If it is set toTRUE, it causes the new member to inherit from the granted role. If set toFALSE, the new member does not inherit. If unspecified when creating a new role membership, this defaults to the inheritance attribute of the new member.\nTheSEToption, if it is set toTRUE, allows the member to change to the granted role using theSET ROLEcommand. If a role is an indirect member of another role, it can useSET ROLEto change to that role only if there is a chain of grants each of which hasSET TRUE. This option defaults toTRUE.\nTo create an object owned by another role or give ownership of an existing object to another role, you must have the ability toSET ROLEto that role; otherwise, commands such asALTER ... OWNER TOorCREATE DATABASE ... OWNERwill fail. However, a user who inherits the privileges of a role but does not have the ability toSET ROLEto that role may be able to obtain full access to the role by manipulating existing objects owned by that role (e.g. they could redefine an existing function to act as a Trojan horse). Therefore, if a role's privileges are to be inherited but should not be accessible viaSET ROLE, it should not own any SQL objects.\nIfGRANTED BYis specified, the grant is recorded as having been done by the specified role. A user can only attribute a grant to another role if they possess the privileges of that role. The role recorded as the grantor must haveADMIN OPTIONon the target role, unless it is the bootstrap superuser. When a grant is recorded as having a grantor other than the bootstrap superuser, it depends on the grantor continuing to possessADMIN OPTIONon the role; so, ifADMIN OPTIONis revoked, dependent grants must be revoked as well.\nUnlike the case with privileges, membership in a role cannot be granted toPUBLIC. Note also that this form of the command does not allow the noise wordGROUPinrole_specification.\n"
    },
    {
      "title": "Notes",
      "text": "TheREVOKEcommand is used to revoke access privileges.\nSincePostgreSQL8.1, the concepts of users and groups have been unified into a single kind of entity called a role. It is therefore no longer necessary to use the keywordGROUPto identify whether a grantee is a user or a group.GROUPis still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word.\nA user may performSELECT,INSERT, etc. on a column if they hold that privilege for either the specific column or its whole table. Granting the privilege at the table level and then revoking it for one column will not do what one might wish: the table-level grant is unaffected by a column-level operation.\nWhen a non-owner of an object attempts toGRANTprivileges on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long as some privilege is available, the command will proceed, but it will grant only those privileges for which the user has grant options. TheGRANT ALL PRIVILEGESforms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur.)\nIt should be noted that database superusers can access all objects regardless of object privilege settings. This is comparable to the rights ofrootin a Unix system. As withroot, it's unwise to operate as a superuser except when absolutely necessary.\nIf a superuser chooses to issue aGRANTorREVOKEcommand, the command is performed as though it were issued by the owner of the affected object. In particular, privileges granted via such a command will appear to have been granted by the object owner. (For role membership, the membership appears to have been granted by the bootstrap superuser.)\nGRANTandREVOKEcan also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privilegesWITH GRANT OPTIONon the object. In this case the privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the role that actually owns the object or holds the privilegesWITH GRANT OPTION. For example, if tablet1is owned by roleg1, of which roleu1is a member, thenu1can grant privileges ont1tou2, but those privileges will appear to have been granted directly byg1. Any other member of roleg1could revoke them later.\nIf the role executingGRANTholds the required privileges indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will be recorded as having done the grant. In such cases it is best practice to useSET ROLEto become the specific role you want to do theGRANTas.\nGranting permission on a table does not automatically extend permissions to any sequences used by the table, including sequences tied toSERIALcolumns. Permissions on sequences must be set separately.\nSeeSection 5.7for more information about specific privilege types, as well as how to inspect objects' privileges.\n"

      "text": "According to the SQL standard, thePRIVILEGESkey word inALL PRIVILEGESis required. The SQL standard does not support setting the privileges on more than one object per command.\nPostgreSQLallows an object owner to revoke their own ordinary privileges: for example, a table owner can make the table read-only to themselves by revoking their ownINSERT,UPDATE,DELETE, andTRUNCATEprivileges. This is not possible according to the SQL standard. The reason is thatPostgreSQLtreats the owner's privileges as having been granted by the owner to themselves; therefore they can revoke them too. In the SQL standard, the owner's privileges are granted by an assumed entity“_SYSTEM”. Not being“_SYSTEM”, the owner cannot revoke these rights.\nAccording to the SQL standard, grant options can be granted toPUBLIC; PostgreSQL only supports granting grant options to roles.\nThe SQL standard allows theGRANTED BYoption to specify onlyCURRENT_USERorCURRENT_ROLE. The other variants are PostgreSQL extensions.\nThe SQL standard provides for aUSAGEprivilege on other kinds of objects: character sets, collations, translations.\nIn the SQL standard, sequences only have aUSAGEprivilege, which controls the use of theNEXT VALUE FORexpression, which is equivalent to the functionnextvalin PostgreSQL. The sequence privilegesSELECTandUPDATEare PostgreSQL extensions. The application of the sequenceUSAGEprivilege to thecurrvalfunction is also a PostgreSQL extension (as is the function itself).\nPrivileges on databases, tablespaces, schemas, languages, and configuration parameters arePostgreSQLextensions.\n"
